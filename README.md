# Configurable Boss Bars
A simple fabric mod to allow for configurations of boss bars 

Ever wanted to customize the bars for The Wither, The End Dragon, and other bosses in the game?

Look no further than this mod!

This mod allows you to (via a mod menu screen, or json file) configure the color for text, the health bar for bosses, and if boss bars display at all!

There's also a configurable hotkey to toggle boss bar display - defaulted to F7.

Overall, a bit of simple functionality, wrapped in a small mod.
